<!-- reconciliation -->
The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.

first tree => actual browser tree

second tree => dom tree(came from create root)


-> reconciliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the "virtual dom"

-> tree updated using setState method


<!-- for improving list performance in "fibre" algorithm -->
-> Diffing of lists is performed using keys. Keys should be "stable , predictable , and unique"



<!-- Fiber -->

->  Fibers are a much lower-level abstraction than application developers typically think about.

-> Specifically, we need to be able to

1) pause work and come back to it later.
2) assign priority to different types of work.
3) reuse previously completed work.
4) abort work if it's no longer needed
